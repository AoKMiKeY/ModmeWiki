> **NOTICE:** The tool is in BETA, some static models need to be fixed. Animations are coming soon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage:
Using Vega is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "base" in order to function.

- The tool features a user interface, just open up a resource file using `Load File`

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the base folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

## Ripping:
- The **.resource** files contain various encoded assets that Vega can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff]
  - Models as [SEModel, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya (Legacy), Kaydara FBX, Cast].
  - Animations as [SEAnim, Cast] (Coming soon).
  
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice:
- SE* formats (SEModel, SEAnim are preferred over any other export format and have guaranteed compatibility).
